# About the Data Warehouse Project
This repository contains a hands-on Data Warehouse project built using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) approach. The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world data engineering workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to curated, analytics-ready datasets. The project demonstrates how raw files stored within the repository can be processed, transformed, and modeled into structured layers that align with industry best practices for building scalable and maintainable Data Warehouses.

What’s inside this repository:
Source Files & Datasets → Sample datasets used for ingestion and transformation, stored within the repo for reproducibility.
Docs → Diagramatic representation of the ETL, approach adopted, and much more.
Scripts → SQL and transformation logic to showcase how data is shaped into meaningful warehouse structures under each layers.
Tests → Validation scripts to ensure data integrity and correctness at silver and gold stages.

Why Medallion Architecture?:
The Medallion approach helps maintain data quality and clarity at each stage:
Bronze Layer → Stores raw, unprocessed data in its original form.
Silver Layer → Cleansed and standardized data, ready for further transformation.
Gold Layer → Business-level curated datasets designed for analytics, BI, and reporting use cases.

Purpose of this project:
This project is intended as a practice ground for building end-to-end Data Warehousing solutions, incorporating:
Data modeling strategies.
Orchestration of pipelines that follow modular and reusable design.
Ensuring data quality with built-in tests.
Clear documentation and visualization for easier understanding by collaborators and reviewers.
Basic and advance analytics
